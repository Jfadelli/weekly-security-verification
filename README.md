## Notes/Comments
1. This will delete files. Do not use if you are not sure that you want to delete all files/folders in the following directories:
  * My Documents
  * My Downloads
  * My Desktop 

2. The program will need to be "taught" what you account name is on your PC, to do so run the Configure File Path function.
3. The program will also need to be "taught" what AV software you have. Currently this is done manually, and will need to be customized on a per user basis. A more user friendly version is under development. 

## Hotkeys
1. Ctrl + Alt + F2 - Configure file path function
2. Ctrl + Alt + F1 - Run main security verification function
3. Esc             - Exit the script

## Dev hotkeys


## Dev Notes:
1. Create python script that asks security verification questions and also displays responses in a text file on desktop
2. Create Selenium script that logs into google drive, creates folder, and uploads the verifivation screenshot
